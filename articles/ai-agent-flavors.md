# AI Agent Flavors - Generative AI vs Agentic AI vs AI Agents

## Introduction

As developers increasingly explore AI-driven applications, it's crucial to distinguish between **Generative AI**, **AI Agents**, and **Agentic AI**. This article breaks down the conceptual and practical differences between these three evolving flavors of artificial intelligence.

## 1. Generative AI

Generative AI refers to models like **Large Language Models (LLMs)** or **Large Image Models** that are trained on vast datasets (text, images, audio, video) and are capable of generating new content.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Models**: LLaMA 3, GPT-4, GPT-4 Mini, etc.
- **Modalities**: Text, image, audio, video generation
- **Capabilities**: Generate blog posts, images, audio clips, code, and more

### Example Use Case:

A chatbot that generates responses based on prompts like:

> "Act as a Data Scientist and conduct a mock interview."

### Nature:

- **Reactive**: Responds based on prompts
- **Prompt-driven**: Input instructions dictate output

### Tools & Libraries:

- [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)
- [LangGraph](https://www.langgraph.dev/)
- [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/)
- OpenAI SDKs

## 2. AI Agents

AI agents use LLMs but are enhanced with **tool usage capabilities**. These agents perform **specific tasks** by making **tool calls** when needed.

### Key Characteristics:

- **Task-focused**: Designed for one-off tasks
- **Tool-calling capability**: Fetch external data via APIs or plugins
- **Example tools**: Tavily for web search, vector DBs, REST APIs

### Example Use Case:

Asking an agent:

> "What's the latest AI news today?"

Since the LLM isn't trained on real-time data, it uses a tool like Tavily API to fetch the latest updates and summarizes the results.

### Nature:
